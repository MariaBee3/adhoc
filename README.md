# adhoc
Adhoc assignment for Bootstrap course Codecademy

## Idea
This page was made as a final assignment for the 'Learn Bootrstrap' course of Codecademy. The assignment was to build a website using Bootstrap based on a design spec sheet. The spec sheet included two designs with the breakpoint of >992px.  

## Approach
My approach was to first set up the basic rows of the page (mobile first). Then I worked my way down row by row, first creating the mobile design and then adding breakpoints to create the desktop design.  

## Challenges
The great thing about Bootstrap is the very accesible documentation. As I worked my way down through the design I could find almost every answer within the documentation. Therefore there were very little challenges. 

## Room to improve
The website only has one breakpoint, it would be nice to include extra breakpoints. And of course the page only consists of a homepage. Extra pages can be added.
